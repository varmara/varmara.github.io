However, in cases of very recent divergence events, the neutral divergence may be too slow, and the analysis of adaptive part of the genome is more informative to reconstruct the recent evolutionary history of young species. The advantage of proteomics is its ability to reflect the biochemical machinery of life. It may help both to identify rapidly evolving genes and to interpret their functions.  Methods Here we applied a comparative gel-based proteomic analysis to several species from the gastropod family Littorinidae. Proteomes were clustered to assess differences related to species, geographic location, sex and body part, using data on presence/absence of proteins in samples and data on protein occurrence frequency in samples of different species. Cluster support was assessed using multiscale bootstrap resampling and the stability of clustering—using cluster-wise index of cluster stability. Taxon-specific protein markers were derived using IndVal method. Proteomic trees were compared to consensus phylogenetic tree (based on neutral genetic markers) using estimates of the Robinson–Foulds distance, the Fowlkes–Mallows index and cophenetic correlation.  Results Overall, the DNA-based phylogenetic tree and the proteomic similarity tree had consistent topologies. Further, we observed some interesting deviations of the proteomic littorinid tree from the neutral expectations. (1) There were signs of molecular parallelism in two Littoraria species that phylogenetically are quite distant, but live in similar habitats. (2) Proteome divergence was unexpectedly high between very closely related Littorina fabalis and L. obtusata, possibly reflecting their ecology-driven divergence. (3) Conservative house-keeping proteins were usually identified as markers for cryptic species groups (“saxatilis” and “obtusata” groups in the Littorina genus) and for genera (Littoraria and Echinolittorina species pairs), while metabolic enzymes and stress-related proteins (both potentially adaptively important) were often identified as markers supporting species branches. (4) In all five Littorina species British populations were separated from the European mainland populations, possibly reflecting their recent phylogeographic history. Altogether our study shows that proteomic data, when interpreted in the context of DNA-based phylogeny, can bring additional information on the evolutionary history of species.","tags":[],"title":"Proteomic similarity of the Littorinid snails in the evolutionary context","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["website"],"content":"  To host a site on GitHub user pages, its contents should be located on master branch of the reposotory username.github.io. A convenient solution would be to store the source code and the site together. I’ve googled two schemes. The common starting point is a locally functionining website, created with blogdown in RStudio (Hugo, Academic theme).\n1. Solution with subtrees The first solution with subtrees occurred simple enough for me, with my little knowledge of git. But later I’ve followed the second, more organized solution.\nOne repository with two branches:\n username.github.io:  source — source code + public folder contents; master — web-version (only public folder contents).   Web version is pushed to remote repository with git subtree push command.\nMain disadvantage of this solution — source branch contains publiс folder.\nIn a blog by Anatoliy (@tolikcode) there is an easy to follow setup description. A deployment process can be automated with a script, suggested by Jente Hidskes. Here I only outline the steps in case I will have to reproduce them later.\nSetup Initialize an empty git repository and commit something unimportant to master, e.g. README.md. Later I’ve learned that there is a way to make empty commit.  git init git add README.md git commit -m \u0026quot;initial commit on master\u0026quot; Create an orphan source branch for source code. Remove public folder and commit everything.  git checkout --orphan source rm -rf public ## removes public!!! git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;initial commit on source branch\u0026quot; Push everything  git remote add origin git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git git push origin master git push origin source Add master to public folder as subtree.  git subtree add --prefix=public git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git master --squash  workflow Make changes to website in RStudio. Get real-time live preview with this command:  blogdown:::serve_site() By default, live preview renders everything to public folder, including drafts.\nGenerate web-version.  Stop live preview, reloading R session or by servr::daemon_stop(\"number, shown by blogdown:::serve_site()\").\nblogdown::hugo_build() Commit changes of the source code to source branch.\ngit add -A git commit -m \u0026quot;update\u0026quot; git push origin source Publish the updated website to master using subtree push.  git subtree push --prefix=public https://github.com/tolikcode/tolikcode.github.io.git master Afterwards the website can be accessed from GitHub user pages http://username.github.io/.\n  2. Solution based on submodules The second submodule-based solution is described in Hugo documentation. At first I could not understand it, but after this video about submodules I worked out how to set up this.\nTwo repositories:\n username-src:  master — source code.  username.github.io:  master — web version (only public folder contents). this repository is added as a submodule to public folder of the username-src repository.   Advantage of this solution — clean history for source code and web version.\nDeployment is automated with a script deploy.sh.\nSetup Generate a web version of the site in the project folder.  hugo -t hugo-academic # If using other theme edit the command to `hugo -t \u0026lt;YOURTHEME\u0026gt;` Initiailze a git repository in public sub-folder and push everything.  cd public git init git remote add origin git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;initial commit of website\u0026quot; git push -u origin master Go to the project folder and totally remove public folder.  cd .. rm -rf public Initialize git repository in the project folder. Add public to .gitignore.  git init git remote add origin git@github.com:username/username-src.git echo \u0026quot;public\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; .gitignore git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;initial commit of source code\u0026quot; git push -u origin master Connect a repository with web version as a submodule to publicfolder.  git submodule add -b master git@github.com varmara/varmara.github.io.git git add . git commit -m \u0026#39;added public as a submodule\u0026#39; git push origin master  Workflow Work on website in RStudio. All changes can be previewed.  blogdown:::serve_site() Сайт будет сгенерирован в public, но не спешите его в таком виде отправлять на гитхаб: предпросмотр рендерит в т.ч. черновики. By default, live preview renders everything to public folder, including drafts.\nAll source code changes can be commited to username-src.\nWhen time has come to update, generate web-version.  Stop live preview, reloading R session or by servr::daemon_stop(\"number, shown by blogdown:::serve_site()\"). Then execute a script deploy.sh, which automatically removes outdated contents of public folder, generates website and commits it to username.github.io.\n#!/bin/bash # a script for easy site deploymend from submodule # make it executable with chmod +x deploy.sh # Set the English locale for the `date` command. export LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 # The commit message.

Testing this approach on the common boreal-Arctic bryozoan Cribrilina annulata in the White Sea, we describe its life history, comparing colonies on two algal substrates with contrasting size and lifespan. Colonies living on kelps were much larger and had a higher proportion of dormant zooids, whereas the percentage of reproducing, feeding and rejuvenating zooids was higher in colonies on red algae (with the colonies also exhibiting longer reproductive period). Colony lifespan was dependent both on substrate type and on time of colony establishment, lasting from 4–5 to up to 17 months on kelps and 14–18 months on red algae. During the reproductive season (May–September) the C. annulata population consisted of colonies of three cohorts on both substrata: overwintered and two summer generations that behaved differently. Whereas overwintered and summer colonies established in June–early August produced larvae, most of the colonies established after mid-summer were preparing for hibernation and postponed reproduction until next spring. Moreover, young reproducing colonies formed brooding hermaphrodite zooids of ordinary size, whereas overwintered colonies budded smaller-sized basal and frontal (dwarf) hermaphrodites. Finally, overall zooidal performance in co-existing colonies of the overwintered and young generations was different on kelps, but similar on red algae. Altogether our findings indicate that the life histories of colonial epibionts are much more complex and evolutionarily flexible than generally acknowledged.","tags":[],"title":"Colonies as dynamic systems: reconstructing the life history of Cribrilina annulata (Bryozoa) on two algal substrates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.Yu.

Statistical analyses of colony composition (zooidal categories, states) encompassed budding, feeding, reproduction, polypide recycling and zooidal dormancy. This enabled documenting colony life and the overall population status at a much better resolution than using traditional methodology. In the ice-free period the colony composition correlated with colony size rather than time of season. F. hispida begins to breed much earlier in the year than all other bryozoan species whose life histories have been studied in the White Sea, and finishes last. Four colony generations co-exist. Young colonies appear in early spring (March) and reproduce in autumn (thus, yielding a daughter generation). Overwintered colonies of those two generations produce larvae whose settlement continues from spring to autumn (October) of the following year, with a break in August. This yields young colonies of daughter and granddaughter generations. Those granddaughter colonies that formed in spring breed in autumn (together with maternal colonies), thus adding a great-granddaughter generation. Maximal colony lifespan is about 2.5 years.

Size-selective predation on dominant species can strongly affect the demography of the prey resulting in indirect community-wide effects. Moon snails (Naticidae: Gastropoda) drill shells of other mollusks, and their feeding habits are thus comparatively easy to trace. Here we test the predation of the Iceland moon snail Amauropsis islandica, preying upon the Baltic tellin Limecola balthica, for size-selectivity in the high-latitude White Sea, combining caging experiments and a 17-years’ survey. The results from both data sources confirm that drilled valves of Limecola are generally larger than living clams. Sizes of the drillholes on the Limecola shells in the sediments evidence that with increasing predator size its’ size-selectivity shifts towards bigger prey, and larger range of sizes becomes available for consumption (0.5–7 mm range for the 2.5 mm Amauropsis and 4–20 mm for the 22.5 mm Amauropsis). In the caging experiment, larger Limecola (8 mm length) are more likely consumed by larger predators (12.1–14.8 mm in height) than by smaller ones (7.1–8.6 mm in height). Size-selective predation by Amauropsis could shape Limecola population as evidenced by the size variation of potentially edible Limecola clams in samples with different density and size of Amauropsis. Since the large Limecola clams may have different ecological functions than small ones, Amauropsis could indirectly influence the intertidal community structure.","tags":[],"title":"Moon snails Amauropsis islandica can shape the population of Baltic clams Limecola balthica by size-selective predation in the high-latitude White Sea","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Google Analytics For each visitor to reach the site, Google Analytics collects the following non-personally identifiable information, including but not limited to browser type, version and language, operating system, pages viewed while browsing the site, page access times and referring website address.

We explored proteomes of 3 closely related littorinid species (the so called ‘saxatilis’-group: Littorina arcana, L. compressa and L. saxatilis) from different tidal levels of one geographic area.","tags":[],"title":"Measuring physiological similarity of closely related littorinid species: a proteomic insight","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dmitriy Aristov","Marina Varfolomeeva","Georgii Puzachenko"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"acd691c04bb147d3299b73d9f37a7630","permalink":"https://varmara.github.io/publication/2015-hydrobia-ulvae-as-a-secondary-prey-for-juveniles-of-iceland-moonsnails/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-hydrobia-ulvae-as-a-secondary-prey-for-juveniles-of-iceland-moonsnails/","section":"publication","summary":"Many size-selective predators switch their diet during ontogeny.

The comparison of δ13C and δ15N stable isotope ratios (SIR) between species is widely used to identify the dietary overlap and competition for food. Results from this approach are sometimes substantially biased by the variation of isotope fractionation rates among species and tissues. We suggest that the difference in SIR within a single species in the presence and absence of a potential competitor provides stronger evidence of feeding interference. In the White Sea, shallow subtidal solitary ascidians Styela rustica L. frequently develop in clumps on horse mussels Modiolus modiolus (L.). Horse mussels without ascidians and ascidian clumps attached to gravel are also common. We analyzed SIR in muscular tissues of neighboring (within 0.25 m2) M. modiolus with and without ascidians attached and in S. rustica from nearby (within 0.25 m2) clumps on gravel and mussels. Species (M. modiolus or S. rustica), tissue (foot and posterior adductor muscles in M. modiolus) and site (8.1 km apart) factors had strong effects on isotope ratios, whilst the presence of a potential competitor had no effect on SIR in either species. We conclude that the diets of M. modiolus and S. rustica are not affected by co-occurrence and do not overlap much, giving no evidence of competition. Further research should take in account the substantial difference in SIR between the 2 M. modiolus muscular tissues studied: −21.582 ± 0.048 (δ13C) and 6.551 ± 0.063 (δ15N) in foot muscle versus −20.970 ± 0.063 (δ13C) and 7.806 ± 0.074 (δ15N) in adductor muscle.","tags":[],"title":"Intraspecific variation in stable isotope signatures indicates no small-scale feeding interference between a horse mussel and an ascidian","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marina Varfolomeeva","Anna Artemieva","Natalia Shunatova","Eugeniy Yakovis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"0ee7584f9729b928de1e8adeaeeb12b4","permalink":"https://varmara.github.io/publication/2008-growth-and-survival-of-barnacles-in-presence-of-co-dominating-solitary-ascidians/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2008-growth-and-survival-of-barnacles-in-presence-of-co-dominating-solitary-ascidians/","section":"publication","summary":"Marine and terrestrial communities are often hierarchically structured by one or more foundation species, which provide habitats for many other taxa. Interactions between coexisting habitat modifiers may have strong effects on patterns and processes in the dependent assemblage. Yet they are rarely studied, especially at a small scale. Small epibenthic patches co-dominated by barnacles Balanus crenatus Brugiere and several species of solitary ascidians in the White Sea soft bottoms support many dependent species. Barnacles occupy bivalve shells, small stones and conspecifics. Ascidian clumps develop on barnacles and their empty shells. Previous observations suggest that at the patch scale ascidians may replace barnacles over several years likely because of the negative interactions between them. Barnacles have distinct annual growth rings on their shells, which we used to trace their growth and survival in the field. No difference between the patches with different dominants would evidence no pronounced negative effect of ascidians. In the patches dominated by ascidians (A) or barnacles (B) collected at the same subtidal site in 2004 and 2005 we compared lengths of recent annual vertical growth increments and dead:live ratios of barnacles of the same age class according to the growth rings. Barnacles grew slower in A than in B, regardless of the biomass of conspecific neighbors. Dead:live ratios were higher in A for age classes 1+…2+ and 4+…9+. Estimated mortality risk between A and B increased with age of barnacles, from around 1:1 to 5.6 times greater in the 9+ age group. Because of the observed difference in growth and survival, the negative effect of adult ascidians on barnacles could not be excluded; alternatively, ascidians may prefer the patches with declining barnacles, or there could be an unknown external process that negatively affects barnacles and favors ascidians.","tags":[],"title":"Growth and survival of barnacles in presence of co-dominating solitary ascidians: growth ring analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugeniy L.

Prior research, focused on single-species or guild-dominated habitats, stressed the role of facilitation in maintaining community structure. However, many habitats are developed by multiple FS from different guilds. Competition between these FS may provide an additional agent potentially responsible for spatial and temporal patterns. In the White Sea, epibenthic patches formed by barnacles (Balanus crenatus) and solitary ascidians (mainly Styela spp. and Molgula spp.) on small stones and empty bivalve shells (mainly Serripes groenlandicus) produce microhabitats for different sessile taxa. We hypothesized that: (1) several FS would provide habitats for most of other species in the community; (2) different FS promote different assemblages of sessile organisms; (3) the interplay of facilitation and competition best explains observed patterns of abundance and demography in FS; and (4) these interactions shape the whole community, increasing the diversity compared to less heterogeneous patches constituted by single FS. We examined 459 patches and the results generally supported this hypothesis. The number of FS in a patch positively affected species diversity. Most sessile species (72\\% of individuals) resided on barnacles, ascidians and red algae, except barnacles that dominated the primary substrate. The size structure of barnacles (live individuals and empty shells) and ascidians were interrelated, suggesting long-term patch dynamics whereby ascidians regularly replace barnacles. Following this replacement, we expect consequent changes to the entire dependent assemblage. Evidence for these changes exists in the spatial pattern: most sessile and motile taxa demonstrated significant associations with either FS. Our results indicate that the small-scale patterns observed in patches formed by multiple FS are primarily generated by facilitation of dependent taxa by FS, and facilitation and competition between different FS.","tags":[],"title":"Multiple foundation species shape benthic habitat islands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugeniy L.

In the shallow subtidal zone in the White Sea in northwestern Russia, barnacles Balanus crenatus are often found in clusters on empty bivalve shells or small stones, sometimes overgrown by solitary ascidians (mainly Styela spp. and Molgula spp.). These epibenthic patches are surrounded with muddy sediment. Sediment also fills the space between barnacle shells within the patches. The assemblages of mobile macrofauna associated with epibenthic patches and surrounding unstructured sediment are different in species composition and abundance. We hypothesised that epibenthic patches at least partially affect mobile benthic organisms with their architectural properties as complex cavity-loaded structures. In a field experiment we assessed the strength of this effect, comparing unmanipulated natural epibenthic patches (E), unmanipulated patches of bare sediment (S), and patches of bare sediment with artificial imitation structures (mimics) added (M). Mimics were made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes and exposed for 1 and 2 yr (half-buried in sediment; 50 tubes × 8 to 9 sets × 2 replications). After 1 or 2 yr of exposure, the assemblages in E and M were much more similar to each other than to S (analysis of similarities, non-metric multidimensional scaling). Most species that were constantly abundant in E responded positively to the treatments. The bivalve Musculus discors and the sigalionid polychaete Pholoe minuta dominated numerically both in E and M, whereas maldanid Rhodine loveni and spionid-like Apistobranchus tullbergi dominated in S. Like many other large aggregated benthic suspension feeders, patched barnacles shape the associated assemblage of mobile benthic fauna with their architectural effect.","tags":[],"title":"Effect of habitat architecture on mobile benthic macrofauna associated with patches of barnacles and ascidians","type":"publication"}]
